## üìñ Project Overview

FashionTrend, a leading online fashion retailer, faces challenges managing a growing and diverse product catalog. This project addresses the problem by using AI to automate product categorization, enhancing search, filtering, and inventory management.

This repository includes:
- AI models (CNN and MobileNetV2) trained for multi-label classification of fashion images.
- A user-friendly **Streamlit app** deployed via Docker for interactive demonstrations.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multi-Label Classification**: Categorizes products by `masterCategory` (e.g., Apparel, Accessories) and `Gender`.
- **Two AI Models**:
  - CNN (79% Accuracy)
  - MobileNetV2 (84% Accuracy)
- **Interactive App**:
  - Single Image Prediction
  - Multiple Image Upload
  - Batch Image Prediction via Zip Files
- **Deployed Live**: Accessible via [Streamlit](https://fashion-image-classifier.streamlit.app/).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Deployment**: Docker
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Preprocessing**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn

---

## üîç How It Works

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Images resized to `128x128 pixels`.
   - Normalization applied for consistent scaling.
   - Augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping to improve model generalization.

### 2. **Model Training**
   - **CNN**: Custom-built model for accuracy and simplicity.
   - **MobileNetV2**: Pretrained model optimized for lightweight deployment.
   - Dataset split: 80% training, 20% validation.

### 3. **Deployment**
   - Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit**.
   - Deployed via Docker for scalability and portability.
